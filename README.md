# Seeboat

This project includes the code, hardware, and fabrication guides for SeeBoat, a community centered waterbody monitoring and data display platform. 

SeeBoat is a fleet of remote controlled boats that measure and display water quality in real time. It allows communities to explore water quality in their local lakes, rivers, and streams by changing the color of the boat in response to changes to the water quality. This data physicalization contextualizes the information and makes the water pollution data present in people's daily lives.

The boats measure water temperature, conductivity, and turbidity and display the data by real-time changes to the colors of the LEDs on the boat. Numeric sensor data is also transmitted via radio, visible through an Android app, and can be further recording using long exposure photos. SeeBoat makes environmental data experiential and interactive to help both communities and researchers better understand pollution and its implications.

The system is based on the Adafruit Feather M0 with RFM95 LoRa Radio (900MHz).
